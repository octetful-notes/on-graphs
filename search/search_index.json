Temporal Graphs What if we could add a time dimension to a graph as well, thereby modelling time variant relationships across the nodes? How would we do this? This section contains some references. There's a conference paper on Network Similarity Prediction in Time Evolving Graphs: A Machine Learning approach that covers some of the basic concepts. There's also another IEEE conference paper on Compact Data Structures for Temporal Graphs covering some of these concepts. Quiver In Mathematics, a quiver is a directed graph where multiple edges between vertices are allowed. In other words it is a multidigraph structre. You can read more on the topic on this Wikipedia article .","title":"Algorithms, Data Structures and Mathematics"},{"location":"graphtheory/#octetful-notes-graphs-graph-theory","text":"This section covers notes on the graph theory topics such as graph algorithms, data structures and mathematics.","title":"Octetful Notes - Graphs - Graph Theory"},{"location":"graphtheory/#temporal-graphs","text":"What if we could add a time dimension to a graph as well, thereby modelling time variant relationships across the nodes?

Graphviz Graphviz is open source graph visualization software. Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks. The DOT Language DOT is a graph description language. DOT graphs are typically files with the filename extension gv or dot. The extension gv is preferred, to avoid confusion with the extension dot used by versions of Microsoft Word before 2007. Various programs can process DOT files. Some, such as dot, neato, twopi, circo, fdp, and sfdp, can read a DOT file and render it in graphical form. Others, such as gvpr, gc, acyclic, ccomps, sccmap, and tred, read DOT files and perform calculations on the represented graph. Finally, others, such as lefty, dotty, and grappa, provide an interactive interface. The GVedit tool combines a text editor with noninteractive image viewer. Most programs are part of the Graphviz package or use it internally. -- Wikipedia You can find the the abstract grammar defining the graph language here . There is also an active Reddit thread of discussions for more graph visualisation libraries . GraphViz React graphviz-react provides a simple to use component for rendering Graphviz objects in React. You can find the source code for graphviz-react on Github . IntelliJ IDEA Plugin There is a plugin that can provide basic editing support for dot language files ( *.dot and *.gv ) in IntelliJ IDEA called the dotPlugin .
