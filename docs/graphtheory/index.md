# Octetful Notes - Graphs - Graph Theory

This section covers notes on the graph theory topics such as graph algorithms, data structures and mathematics.

## Temporal Graphs
What if we could add a time dimension to a graph as well, thereby modelling time variant relationships across the nodes?
How would we do this? This section contains some references.

There's a conference paper on [Network Similarity Prediction in Time Evolving Graphs: A Machine Learning approach](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324175159_Network_Similarity_Prediction_in_Time-Evolving_Graphs_A_Machine_Learning_Approach) that covers some of the basic concepts.

There's also another IEEE conference paper on [Compact Data Structures for Temporal Graphs](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6543087) covering some of these concepts.

## Quiver
In Mathematics, a quiver is a directed graph where multiple edges between vertices are allowed. In other words it is a multidigraph structre. You can read more on the topic on this [**Wikipedia article**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiver_(mathematics)).
