# Octetful Notes - Graphs - Graph Databases

This section covers graph databases and graph compute engines along with some other tools and libraries.


## [Neo4J](./neo4j/)
> Neo4j is a highly scalable native graph database, purpose-built to leverage not only data but also data relationships.
>Using Neo4j, developers build intelligent applications that traverse today's large, interconnected datasets in real time. Powered by a native graph storage and processing engine, Neo4j delivers an intuitive, flexible and secure database for unique, actionable insights. 

This section covers details of the Neo4J graph database.

## [Apache Tinkerpop](./tinkerpop/)
>Apache TinkerPop™ is a graph computing framework for both graph databases (OLTP) and graph analytic systems (OLAP).

This section covers details of the Apache Tinkerpop framework.


## Other Graph Databases & Frameworks

### JGraphT
>[**JGraphT**](https://jgrapht.org/) is a Java library of graph theory data structures and algorithms

There's an [Overview for Application Developers](https://jgrapht.org/guide/UserOverview) to help get you started with using the JGraphT library in your own applications.

### BlazeGraph
>[**Blazegraph™ DB**](https://github.com/blazegraph/database) is a ultra high-performance graph database supporting Blueprints and RDF/SPARQL APIs. It supports up to 50 Billion edges on a single machine. It is in production use for Fortune 500 customers such as EMC, Autodesk, and many others. It is supporting key Precision Medicine applications and has wide-spread usage for life science applications. It is used extensively to support Cyber anaytics in commercial and government applications. It powers the Wikimedia Foundation's Wikidata Query Service.

### JanusGraph
>[**JanusGraph**](https://janusgraph.org/)  is a scalable graph database optimized for storing and querying graphs containing hundreds of billions of vertices and edges distributed across a multi-machine cluster. JanusGraph is a project under The Linux Foundation, and includes participants from Expero, Google, GRAKN.AI, Hortonworks, IBM and Amazon.

### NeptuneDB
>[**Amazon Neptune**](https://aws.amazon.com/neptune/) is a fast, reliable, fully managed graph database service that makes it easy to build and run applications that work with highly connected datasets.

You can explore more details of the [Neptune Graph Data Model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/userguide/feature-overview-data-model.html).
